    "\n",
    "+ What are the optimal times of day, days of the week, and times of the year for minimizing flight delays?\n",
    "+ What are the primary factors contributing to flight delays?\n",
    "+ What factors predominantly lead to flight cancellations?\n",
    "+ Which flight experiences the most frequent and significant delays and cancellations?\n",
    "\n",
    "+ For each question, utilize Pig or Hive to extract insights from the dataset and generate figures to explain your findings using Python or R. Please use your creativity to answer these questions, and you are encouraged to search online for ideas of how others have tackled similar challenges, such as on this link: https://tinyurl.com/bdejna9e.\n",
