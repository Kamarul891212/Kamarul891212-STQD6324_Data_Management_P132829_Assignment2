Topic: Flight data for year 2007

Have you ever found yourself stranded in an airport due to a delayed or cancelled flight, pondering if the situation could have been anticipated? This project offers an opportunity to explore such scenarios.

In this project, we will use data from Kaggle: https://tinyurl.com/u8rzvdsx, encompassing airline performance data from 1995 to 2007. We will choose the year 2007 for this analysis.
The challenge:

These analysis will deterimine the followings:
• The optimal times of day, days of the week, and times of the year for minimizing flight delays
• The primary factors contributing to flight delays
• Factors predominantly lead to flight cancellations
• Which flight experiences the most frequent and significant delays and cancellations?

This analysis will utilize Hive to extract insights from the dataset and generate figures using Python.
